# Installing SWI-Prolog

### Linux

1. **Using Package Manager:**
   - **Debian/Ubuntu:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install swi-prolog
     ```
   - **Fedora:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install swipl
     ```
   - **Arch Linux:**
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S swi-prolog
     ```

2. **From Source:**
   - Download the latest version from the [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
   - Extract the tarball and navigate into the directory:
     ```bash
     tar -xzf swipl-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
     cd swipl-X.Y.Z
     ```
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

### macOS

1. **Using Homebrew:**
   If you don’t have Homebrew installed, you can install it using:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   Then install SWI-Prolog:
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew install swi-prolog
   ```

2. **From Source:**
   - Download the latest version from the [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
   - Extract, configure, and install using:
     ```bash
     tar -xzf swipl-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
     cd swipl-X.Y.Z
     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

### Windows

1. **Using Installer:**
   - Go to the [SWI-Prolog downloads page](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
   - Download the Windows installer (usually an `.exe` file).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

2. **Using Chocolatey:**
   If you have Chocolatey installed, you can use:
   ```bash
   choco install swi-prolog
   ```
### Verification

After installation, you can verify that SWI-Prolog is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:
```bash
swipl
```
This should launch the SWI-Prolog interpreter. If you see the prompt, you're good to go!

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required packages for this project, navigate to your project directory and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Example

To run the A* example using Streamlit, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run example_streamlit.py
```

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the Streamlit interface. Make sure you have Streamlit installed in your environment before running the command.

## Astar program 
This document details the implementation of the Prolog A* algorithm, designed for pathfinding between streets. The algorithm utilizes a graph-based structure generated by the accompanying script get_map.py. This script constructs a graph, including the respective nodes and edges, representing the street layout for the pathfinding process.\
The Prolog predicate astar/4 serves as the main entry point for executing the A* pathfinding algorithm. It is designed to find the shortest path from a given starting node (Start) to a destination node (Goal), returning the computed path (Path) and the total cost (Cost) of traversal.

Predicate Definition:
``` bash
astar(Start, Goal, Path, Cost)
```
Parameters:

	•	Start: The starting node from which the search begins.
	•	Goal: The target node where the search should end.
	•	Path: The list of nodes representing the shortest path from Start to Goal.
	•	Cost: The total cost associated with traversing the computed path.


## Get Map 
This project utilizes the osmnx library to extract a city’s street network data. The library generates a structured graph, mapping node IDs to sequential integers and defining the corresponding edges. This processed information is then written to a file named city_data.pl. The output in this file is structured in the following format:

#### Locations Section:
```prolog
% Locations in the city (Nodes)
location(1, 'Intersection 1').
location(2, 'Intersection 2').
...
```
#### Streets Section:
```prolog
% Streets between locations (Edges with Distances as Weights)
% street(Node1, Node2, Distance).
street(1, 2, 0.50, 'Main St').
street(2, 3, 0.75, 'Second Ave').
...
```

#### Save node coordinates
Also, get_map saves which node's coordinates on a csv file 

## Exemple Streamlit
This Streamlit application is designed to help users find the shortest path between two streets using an A* algorithm implemented in Prolog. By printing the best route on a map made with Folium Map
