# A* implementation using prolog and python
![Prolog](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fca32bc-99e8-428c-9a97-c5b9c992d2dc)

## Astar program 
This document details the implementation of the Prolog A* algorithm, designed for pathfinding between streets. The algorithm utilizes a graph-based structure generated by the accompanying script get_map.py. This script constructs a graph, including the respective nodes and edges, representing the street layout for the pathfinding process.\
The Prolog predicate astar/4 serves as the main entry point for executing the A* pathfinding algorithm. It is designed to find the shortest path from a given starting node (Start) to a destination node (Goal), returning the computed path (Path) and the total cost (Cost) of traversal.

Predicate Definition:
``` bash
astar(Start, Goal, Path, Cost)
```
Parameters:

	•	Start: The starting node from which the search begins.
	•	Goal: The target node where the search should end.
	•	Path: The list of nodes representing the shortest path from Start to Goal.
	•	Cost: The total cost associated with traversing the computed path.


## Get Map 
This project utilizes the osmnx library to extract a city’s street network data. The library generates a structured graph, mapping node IDs to sequential integers and defining the corresponding edges. This processed information is then written to a file named city_data.pl. The output in this file is structured in the following format:

#### Locations Section:
```prolog
% Locations in the city (Nodes)
location(1, 'Intersection 1').
location(2, 'Intersection 2').
...
```
#### Streets Section:
```prolog
% Streets between locations (Edges with Distances as Weights)
% street(Node1, Node2, Distance).
street(1, 2, 0.50, 'Main St').
street(2, 3, 0.75, 'Second Ave').
...
```

#### Save node coordinates
Also, get_map saves which node's coordinates on a csv file 

## Exemple Streamlit
This Streamlit application is designed to help users find the shortest path between two streets using an A* algorithm implemented in Prolog. By printing the best route on a map made with Folium Map
